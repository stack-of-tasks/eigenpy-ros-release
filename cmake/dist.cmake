# .rst: .. command:: _SETUP_PROJECT_DIST
#
# .. _target-dist:
#
# Add a *dist* target to generate a tarball using ``git-archive``.
#
# Linux specific: use ``git-archive-all.sh`` to obtain a recursive
# ``git-archive`` on the project's submodule. Please note that
# ``git-archive-all.sh`` is not carefully written and create a temporary file in
# the source directory (which is then moved to the build directory).
